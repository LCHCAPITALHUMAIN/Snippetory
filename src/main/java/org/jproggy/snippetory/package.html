The classes necessary for the work with the Snippetory Template Engine.
This package contains all classes that are intended to be the interface for the
usage of the template engine. I.e. reading the templates, composing the texts,
binding the data and so on. 
<p>
In most cases it should be fine to start with {@link org.jproggy.snippetory.Repo Repo} and select proposals
of your IDE. The fluent interface offers great guidance here.

At some point you will have to deal with several {@link org.jproggy.snippetory.Template Templates}
